This demo implements the [printer][1] example in the Ice Manual.

To run the demo, first start the server:
```
cd Server
server
```

In a separate window, start the client:
```
cd Client
client
```

> With .NET Core 2.x, use instead:
> ```
> cd Server
> dotnet server.dll
> ```
> and
> ```
> cd Client
> dotnet client.dll
> ```
